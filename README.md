# Picture-in-Picture

This project is based upon HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have created this project to watch the videos (tutorials or YouTube) while I'm coding on my editor. 

I can just initiate the project in the browser and it will ask for which window do I need to share.

Then I select whichever window/tab I want to share and click on `start` button and it will start showing the picture-in-picture.

I just move that small video window on the corner of the Visual studio and do coding without switching to other applications.
